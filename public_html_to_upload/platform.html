        <h3>Ratified July 29th, 2021</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This platform was created after several months of community outreach, polling, research, and internal discussion and debate. It represents our vision for a progressive future for Malden. We believe that our government should work for everyone, regardless of identity or class.</p>

        <p>Currently, the city primarily checks for the presence of lead pipes when homes are sold. Then, lead pipes are scheduled for replacement.</p>
        <p>We believe that renters should also be protected from the effects of lead pipes. We want the city to expand its pipe testing policy to include testing when new renters move into an existing building.</p>

        <p>The current Malden Traffic Commission focuses primarily on car traffic, which ignores other modes of transport that are important to a robust traffic plan.</p>

        <p>Malden is growing. <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Redistricting/MassachusettsCensusData/CityTown">Malden's population is up about 10% according to 2020 census data.</a></p>
        <p>Affordable housing is one of the most important issues in the greater Boston metro, including here in Malden.</p>
        <p>As new dwellings are constructed, we believe that affordable units should be included to help prevent Maldonians from being priced out of their neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>We believe that landlords, especially ones controlling large amounts of units, need to be held accountable for failing to maintain their properties.</p>
        <p>The city was lucky that <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/malden-massachusetts-apartment-building-parapet-collapse-march-27-2021/35956715#">the parapet collapse at the Mount Vernon Apartments</a>, thankfully, did not hurt anyone. However, this is a clear example that Malden's landlords need more oversight. Our tenants must be protected from unclean or dangerous conditions caused by landlord neglect.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we believe that landlords that are quite obviously running a large scale business by owning dozens of units should be treated and taxed like a business.</p>

        <p>The city of Malden should create a process allowing workers to report wage theft violations, and hold violating employers accountable.</p>
