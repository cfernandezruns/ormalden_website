        <h3>Who is being elected?</h3>
        <p>In Malden, city councillors and school committee members are elected every two years.</p>
        <p>These elections occur on odd years, between state and federal elections. This happened in 2017, 2019, and now in 2021.</p>
        <p>Along with the mayor, the city council decides how Malden's government operates and how Malden's tax dollars are spent.</p>
        <p>The school committee is a separate team of elected officials that are specifically tasked with overseeing Malden Public Schools.</p>

        <h3>Voting by mail</h3>
        <h4>Yes! You can vote by mail this year!</h4>  
        <p>The state passed a law that vote by mail ballots will be allowed in all state and local elections through Dec. 15th 2021 due to the COVID pandemic. This means that any registered voters in Massachusetts can request to receive their ballot by mail.</p>
        <p>In addition to improved safety, voting at home also allows voters the convenience of voting early. They can also take as much time as they need with their ballot, and are free to research the candidates before mailing in their vote.</p>

        <p>To vote by mail, registered voters must fill out a Vote by Mail application. Once your application is completed and submitted, your ballot will be mailed to you.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.cityofmalden.org/DocumentCenter/View/4191/2021-Vote-by-Mail-English-PDF?bidId=">2021 Vote by Mail application (English)</a></p>

        <p>The application states that it must be RECEIVED by the Malden city hall 'by the 4th business day before the election', which is October 27th, 2021. OR Malden recommends mailing the application by Friday, October 22nd, to allow time for postage. Otherwise, you can drop off your application in person at Malden City Hall, at the <a href="https://www.cityofmalden.org/180/City-Clerk">Clerk's Office</a> on the second floor.</p>

        <p>Your ballot must be returned to the city clerk by Election Day (Nov 2nd). Again, be sure to account for postage time.</p>

        <h3>What if I'm not registered?</h3>
        <p>The voter registration deadline for the 2021 election is Wednesday, October 13th.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ovr/">Massachusetts Online Voter Registration</a></p>
        <p>Or, you can also fill out a voter registration form and submit it to city hall:</p>
